# 🚀 Ralph Loop Quick Start Guide

## WHAT IS RALPH LOOP?

Ralph Loop is an autonomous AI developer that will build all 10 AI SDK SaaS products for you, running completely hands-off for 24-48 hours.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: START FROM TERMINAL, NOT CLAUDE CODE!

Ralph needs to create its own Claude Code sessions. You MUST run this from a standard terminal:

1. Open Terminal.app (Cmd+Space, type "Terminal")
2. Navigate: cd /Users/mkazi/AI-SDK-PROJECTS
3. Run: ./start-ralph.sh

## 📊 MONITOR RALPH'S PROGRESS

In another terminal window:

./check-ralph-progress.sh     # Quick status check
cat .ralph/status.json | jq    # Detailed status
tail -f .ralph/logs/ralph.log   # Live logs
tmux attach -t ai-sdk-projects  # Attach to Ralph's session
